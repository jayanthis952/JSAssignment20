Async/await in JavaScript can help with performance and scalability in several ways:

Non-blocking code execution: Async/await allows you to write non-blocking code, which means that your code can continue executing without waiting for a long-running operation to complete. This can help prevent blocking and keep the application responsive, which in turn improves performance.

Parallelism: Async/await allows you to execute multiple tasks in parallel, which can help improve performance and scalability. By using the Promise.all() method, you can execute multiple asynchronous operations concurrently and wait for them all to complete before continuing.

Error handling: Async/await makes it easier to handle errors in asynchronous code. With traditional callback-based code, error handling can quickly become complicated and error-prone. Async/await simplifies error handling by allowing you to use try/catch blocks to handle errors in a more familiar way.

Readability: Async/await can make your code more readable and easier to understand. By using async/await, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, which can make it easier to reason about and debug.

Overall, async/await can help improve performance and scalability by allowing you to write non-blocking, parallel, and error-resistant code that is easier to read and maintain.

2) Is it possible to use async/await with promise chains? If yes,
how can this be achieved?

Yes, it is possible to use async/await with Promise chains in JavaScript.

To do this, you can use the await keyword within an async function to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved or rejected. You can then use the result of the Promise in the subsequent Promise chain.

Here's an example:

async function getData() {
  try {
    const response1 = await fetch('https://example.com/data1');
    const data1 = await response1.json();
    
    const response2 = await fetch(`https://example.com/data2/${data1.id}`);
    const data2 = await response2.json();

    return data2;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

getData().then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error(error));

In this example, getData() is an async function that performs two API calls using the fetch() method. The await keyword is used to wait for each Promise to resolve before proceeding to the next step. The function returns the data from the second API call.

Note that the try/catch block is used to catch any errors that may occur during the Promise chain.

Finally, the getData() function is called using .then() and .catch() to handle the resolved data or any errors that may have occurred.

3)Give 3 real world examples where async/await has been used?

Fetching data from an API: When you use an API to fetch data, it's an asynchronous operation. You don't know when the data will arrive, so it's useful to use async/await to wait for the response before doing something with it. For example:
async function fetchUserData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user');
    const userData = await response.json();
    console.log(userData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

fetchUserData();
2.Uploading a file: When a user uploads a file, it's an asynchronous operation, and it may take a while to complete. You can use async/await to make sure that your code waits until the file is uploaded before doing something else. For example:
async function uploadFile(file) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: file
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

const fileInput = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]');
const file = fileInput.files[0];
uploadFile(file);

3.Performing multiple tasks in parallel: Sometimes you need to perform multiple tasks in parallel, but you don't want to wait for each one to complete before moving on to the next one. You can use async/await with Promise.all() to run multiple promises at the same time. For example:
async function fetchUsersAndPosts() {
  try {
    const [usersResponse, postsResponse] = await Promise.all([
      fetch('https://api.example.com/users'),
      fetch('https://api.example.com/posts')
    ]);
    const usersData = await usersResponse.json();
    const postsData = await postsResponse.json();
    console.log(usersData, postsData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

fetchUsersAndPosts();

4)async function inc(x) {
x = x + await 1
return x;
}
async function increment(x){
x = x + 1
return x
}
inc(1).then(function(x){
increment(x).then(function(x){
console.log(x)
})
})

Find output.

The output of the provided JavaScript code will be 3.

Here's how the code execution flows:

inc(1) is called, which returns a promise.

increment(x) is called with the resolved value of the promise from step 1, which increments it by 1 and returns another promise.

The resolved value of the promise from step 2 is logged to the console.

Let's break down the values of x at each step of the execution:

When inc(1) is called, x is 1.
await 1 in inc(x) evaluates to 1, which is added to x, making it 2.
increment(x) is called with x being 2, which increments it by 1, making it 3.
The resolved value of the promise from step 2 is logged to the console, which is 3.

5)let p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
reject(new Error("some error"));
setTimeout(function(){
reject(new Error("some error"));

},1000)
reject(new Error("some error"));
});
p.then(null, function (err) {
console.log(1);
console.log(err);
}).catch(function (err) {
console.log(2);
console.log(err);
});
Find output.
Answer:

1
Error: some error

Explanation:

We create a new Promise called p that immediately calls reject with an Error object containing the message "some error".
Then, after 1 second, we try to reject the promise again with the same error.
Finally, we reject the promise for the third time with the same error.
We then attach a then handler to p that will log the error message and the number 1 to the console. Since p was rejected with an error, this then handler will not be executed.
We then attach a catch handler to p that will log the error message and the number 2 to the console. Since p was rejected with an error, this catch handler will be executed and will log the error message "some error" and the number 2 to the console.


6)async function f1() {
console.log(1);
}
async function f1() {
console.log(2);
}
console.log(3);
f1();
console.log(1);
f2();
async function f2() {
console.log("Go!");
}

Find output.
Answer:

3
1
2
undefined
Go!

The console.log(3) statement is executed, which outputs 3 to the console.

The f1() function is called. Since f1() is an async function, it returns a promise immediately, and its code execution is paused until the promise is resolved.

The console.log(1) statement is executed, which outputs 1 to the console.

The f2() function is called. Since f2() is an async function, it returns a promise immediately, and its code execution is paused until the promise is resolved.

The console.log(2) statement is executed, which outputs 2 to the console.

The f2() function promise is resolved, and it logs Go! to the console.

The f1() function promise is resolved, but it does not have a return statement, so it returns undefined.

Therefore, the final output to the console would be 3, 1, 2, undefined, and Go!.

7)function resolveAfterNSeconds(n,x) {
return new Promise(resolve => {

setTimeout( ( ) = {
resolve(x);
}, n);
});
}

(function(){
let a = resolveAfterNSeconds(1000,1)
a.then(async function(x){
let y = await resolveAfterNSeconds(2000,2)
let z = await resolveAfterNSeconds(1000,3)
let p = resolveAfterNSeconds(2000,4)
let q = resolveAfterNSeconds(1000,5)
console.log(x+y+z+await p +await q);
})
})()

Find output.
Answer:
The output of the code will be 10 printed in the console after a delay of approximately 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

Here's a breakdown of how the output is obtained:

The resolveAfterNSeconds function returns a Promise that resolves after a given number of milliseconds, n, with the value x.
In the main function, a is set to a Promise that resolves after 1000 milliseconds with the value 1.
The a Promise's .then() method is called with an async function that does the following:
a. y is set to a Promise that resolves after 2000 milliseconds with the value 2.
b. z is set to a Promise that resolves after 1000 milliseconds with the value 3.
c. p is set to a Promise that resolves after 2000 milliseconds with the value 4.
d. q is set to a Promise that resolves after 1000 milliseconds with the value 5.
e. console.log(x+y+z+await p +await q) is called, where x is the value of the a Promise (1), y has the value 2 after it resolves, z has the value 3 after it resolves, and p and q have not yet resolved. await p and await q are used to wait for p and q to resolve before adding their values to the sum.
The final result of the sum x+y+z+await p +await q is 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5).
The result is printed to the console after a delay of approximately 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

8)Is it possible to nest async functions in JavaScript? Explain with
examples.

Yes, it is possible to nest async functions in JavaScript. Async functions are functions that return a Promise, and they can contain other async functions or Promises.

async function main() {
  console.log("Start");

  const result = await fetchData();
  console.log(result);

  const nestedResult = await nestedFunction();
  console.log(nestedResult);

  console.log("End");
}

async function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched successfully");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function nestedFunction() {
  const nestedResult = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Nested function completed");
    }, 1000);
  });

  return nestedResult;
}

main();

9)What is the best way to avoid deadlocks when using
async/await?

Use non-blocking code: Avoid writing code that blocks the event loop. This can be done by using asynchronous operations, such as setTimeout or setInterval, or by using asynchronous libraries that allow you to perform operations without blocking the event loop.

Use Promise.race(): When using multiple await statements, wrap them in a Promise.race() statement. This ensures that the first await statement that resolves will continue execution, while the other await statements will be cancelled.

Use timeouts: Set a timeout for long-running operations to prevent them from blocking the event loop for too long.

Use concurrency: Use concurrency to prevent blocking the event loop. You can achieve concurrency by using worker threads or by offloading work to a separate process.

Use a debugger: Debugging is an essential part of avoiding deadlocks. Use a debugger to trace the flow of execution and identify the root cause of any issues.

By following these tips, you can write asynchronous code that is less likely to result in deadlocks.

10)In which scenarios would you use synchronous code instead of
asynchronous code?
asynchronous code:

When the operation is short-lived: If the operation is very short-lived and doesn't block the main thread for too long, using synchronous code can be simpler and easier to understand.

When there is no need for parallelism: If the operation doesn't need to be performed in parallel with other tasks and can be executed sequentially without any issues, synchronous code can be used.

When the code is executed in a single-threaded environment: If the code is executed in a single-threaded environment, there is no benefit to using asynchronous code. In fact, using asynchronous code could add unnecessary complexity.

When the code is used for testing or debugging: In some cases, synchronous code can be easier to test and debug than asynchronous code.
